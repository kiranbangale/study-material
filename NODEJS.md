  NodeJs is build on google chromes V8 engine. As javascript was not built for carring out operating system level tasks it uses V8 engine for interpreting OS level operations. V8 engine is built in C++ language which is able to do OS level tasks. Nodejs provides various modules/packages/apis to deal OS level operations, whenever user uses these modules/packages/apis it gets converted into C++ language by V8 engine and then OS level operations are carried out by C++ and the output is served and againg its converted in js and gets served.
